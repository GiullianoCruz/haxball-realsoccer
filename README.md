<h1>Haxball Real Soccer</h1>
<p>Script by Giulliano (zirig) for <a href='https://www.haxball.com/headless'>haxball headless</a>.</p>

<p>This script was originally created by the <a href='https://grandesligashaxball.wixsite.com/grandesligashaxball/headlesshostbrasil'>GLH</a> guys, so a huge part of the RS mechanics comes from their open-source (amazing) code.</p>
<p>New mechanics and updates to this code are not used for any specific server, but free to use by all players such as myself and yourself that is reading this. That being said, this repository is open for new ideas and increments from the community.</p>
<p>Thanks and have fun!</p>
